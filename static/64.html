  Into the Wild
 </h1> 
<h2>Author name:Jon Krakauer</h2>
<p>
<h2>Summary:</h2>
In April 1992 a young man from a well-to-do family hitchhiked to Alaska and walked alone into the wilderness north of Mt. McKinley. His name was Christopher Johnson McCandless. He had given $25,000 in savings to charity, abandoned his car and most of his possessions, burned all the cash in his wallet, and invented a new life for himself.
