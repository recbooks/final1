  The 3 Mistakes Of My Life
 </h1> 
<h2>Author name:Chetan Bhagat</h2>
<p>
<h2>Summary:</h2>
In late 2000, a young boy in Ahmedabad dreams of owning a business. To accommodate his friends' passion, he opens a cricket shop. However, nothing comes easy in a turbulent city. To realise their goals, they will have to face it all-religious politics, calamities, unacceptable love and, above all, their own mistakes. Will they make it? Can an individual's dreams overcome the nightmares of real life? Can we succeed despite mistakes? Based on real events, from bestselling author Chetan Bhagat comes another dark, witty tale about modern India, where the author brings the ethos and isolation of an entire generation to the fore.
