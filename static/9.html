  Autobiography of a Yogi
 </h1> 
<h2>Author name:Autobiography of a Yogi</h2>
<p>
<h2>Summary:</h2>
In his lifetime and since his death, Paramhansa Yogananda has inspired thousands of people worldwide to adopt a spiritual lifestyle. He brought yoga to the West, where he established churches, spending nearly three decades teaching yoga and meditation. Autobiography of a Yogi tells the story of Yogananda’s search for spiritual enlightenment, his relationship with his guru and his teachings in Kriya Yoga. The book gives a compelling insight into the spiritual leader as he takes us on his journey from his early childhood in Gorakhpur to California in the 1940s. Along the way, we are introduced to the men and women who had a lasting impact on his life – and those whose lives he changed forever.
