  One Indian Girl
 </h1> 
<h2>Author name:Chetan Bhagat</h2>
<p>
<h2>Summary:</h2>
Hi, I'm Radhika Mehta and I'm getting married this week. I work at Goldman Sachs, an investment bank. Thank you for reading my story. However, let me warn you. You may not like me too much. One, I make a lot of money. Two, I have an opinion on everything. Three, I have had a boyfriend before. Ok, maybe two. Bestselling author Chetan Bhagat, writing for the first time in a female voice, brings to you One Indian Girl, the heart-warming story of a modern Indian girl. Now if all this was the case with a guy, one might be cool with it. But since I am a girl these three things I mentioned don't really make me too likeable, do they?
