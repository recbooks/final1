<h2>Summary:</h2>
Fifty Shades Freed is a book that focuses on the lives of Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey. Anastasia is an unworldly student who falls for the striking young entrepreneur, Christian Grey.

Much to Christian's dismay, Anastasia seeks deeper commitment, which is something he eventually gives in to as he doesn't want her to leave him.
